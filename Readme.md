# What is this repo for?
This is a fork of [this repo](https://github.com/Funbit/ets2-telemetry-server), I've taken the already existing GUI and Telemetry API and integrated a Discord bot into it, not much else to it. I'm open to pull requests, if something comes up, please make an issues post [here](https://github.com/ijre/ets2_status-bot/issues).  

Steps for setup:  
1. Go to [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and click New Application
2. Click Bot, located at the left side
3. Click Add Bot
4. Under where it says "Click to Reveal Token", click "Copy"
5. Come back to this page, and go to the most recent release page located [here](https://github.com/ijre/ets2_status-bot/releases/latest)
6. Download the .7z file and unpack into a folder of your choosing
7. Create a file named ``id.txt``, and put the token you copied earlier inside of the file you just created.

There you go! That should be everything.
