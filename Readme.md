# What is this repo for?
**This repo is for a Discord bot, specifically a bot who will tell those who do the command in Discord, your current status/stats in ETS2 (and maybe ATS, untested) on command.  
Due to the way this bot works, you'll need to host the bot yourself, either on your PC or from another device.**
